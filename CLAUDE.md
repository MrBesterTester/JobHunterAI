# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

JobHunter is a workflow-driven job application management system built to streamline job search processes. The application helps automatically collect, filter, and manage job opportunities based on specific criteria.

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Rust (Actix-web framework)
- Frontend: TypeScript/React with Create React App
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Developer Preferences

### Notifications
**IMPORTANT**: Always send macOS notifications WITH SOUND when completing long-running tasks (>30 seconds).

**Command to use:**
```bash
osascript -e "display notification \"[message]\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Glass\""
```

**When to send notifications:**
- After running test suites (backend cargo test, E2E playwright tests)
- After build operations (cargo build, npm build)
- After extended operations that take >30 seconds
- When waiting for user input after completing a complex multi-step task

**Important notes:**
- ALWAYS include `sound name "Glass"` parameter for audible notification
- Sound helps ensure notification is noticed even if visual is missed
- Appears in macOS Notification Center (top-right corner, click clock/date to view)

**Example usage:**
```bash
# After tests complete
osascript -e "display notification \"Test suite completed - 77/78 backend tests passing, +30 E2E tests fixed\" with title \"Claude Code - Tests Complete\" sound name \"Glass\""

# After build
osascript -e "display notification \"Build completed successfully\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Glass\""

# Ready for input
osascript -e "display notification \"Task completed - ready for your input\" with title \"Claude Code\" sound name \"Glass\""
```

## Development Commands

### Database Setup
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL (macOS)
brew install postgresql@14
brew services start postgresql@14

# Create database and user
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE jobhunter;
CREATE USER jobhunter_user WITH PASSWORD 'jobhunter_dev_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE jobhunter TO jobhunter_user;
\q

# Run schema
psql -U jobhunter_user -d jobhunter -f database/schema.sql
```

### Backend (Rust)
```bash
cd backend
cargo build          # Build the project
cargo run            # Run development server (http://localhost:8080)
cargo test            # Run tests
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install           # Install dependencies
npm start            # Development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm test             # Run tests
```

## Architecture

### Core Data Models
The system centers around three main entities:
- **Jobs**: Job postings collected from various sources with filtering criteria
- **Applications**: Job applications with resume/cover letter versions
- **Communications**: Tracking of all communication related to applications

### Database Schema Key Features
- UUID primary keys throughout
- PostgreSQL-specific features (JSONB, arrays, triggers)
- Automated `updated_at` timestamps
- Views for common queries (`pending_approval_jobs`, `application_stats`, `jobs_with_applications`)
- Deduplication system using content hashes

### Job Filtering Criteria
- Minimum salary: $130,000
- Domain focus: Software/Firmware Testing, Test Automation, Generative AI
- Location: Remote preferred, or ≤45 min from Fremont, CA
- Commute: ≤3 days/week if required

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Core system with manual job entry
2. **Phase 2**: Gmail integration and automated filtering
3. **Phase 3**: Resume/cover letter generation with LLM integration
4. **Phase 4**: Job board integrations (LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced features (scheduling, analytics, mobile)
